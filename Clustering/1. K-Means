Algo 1:

unsupervised ml algo (no label)

choose center no.s
select at random k point centroids
assign data point to closest centroid
calculate new centroid
repeat steps until centroid is fixed.

intra cluster distance ↓
inter cluster distance ↑
because we want to differentiate b/w diff cluster groups


Algo 2(Elbow method):

optimal no. of clusters
min WCSS value
Elbow point- After which value decreases normally
