intuition 1:

bottom up approach & doesnt require no. of clusters as input

algo:
each point as cluster
2 nearest points form 1 cluster
take closest clusters and combine them
repeat till 1 cluster is left


2(dendogram):

create dendogram
find the longest line
pass a plane through mid of it
the no. of lines it cuts is the no. of optimal clusters
