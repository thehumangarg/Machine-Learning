Supervised(because both input and outputs are labelled and output depends on input)-> classification, regression
  classification-> discrete, regression-> continuous 

Unsupervised-> only imput parameters
  Clustering-> grouping and finding on basis of multiple inputs.
  Association-> suppermarket example wrt

semi-supervised-> mixed(image datasets processing)

Reinforcement-> Bots(perform and get rewarded->increases performance(competes with itself and human))
